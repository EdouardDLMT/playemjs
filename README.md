playemjs
========

Play'em is a javascript component that manages a music/video track queue and plays a sequence of songs by embedding several players in a HTML DIV including Youtube, Soundcloud and Vimeo.

You can run tests from that page: [PlayemJS Video Player Tests](http://rawgit.com/adrienjoly/playemjs/master/test/index.html)

In the mean time, you can clone the project, read the sources of the 3 test directories, and run them locally.

Any help in documenting/fixing/developing this project is welcome! :-)
